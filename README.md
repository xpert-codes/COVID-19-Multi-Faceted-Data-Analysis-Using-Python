The code utilizes several Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Here are the main libraries used:

pandas: For data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning.
numpy: For mathematical calculations.
plotly.express: For creating interactive visualizations.
plotly.graph_objects: For creating more customized visualizations.
plotly.subplots: For creating subplots.
To run the code, you'll need to have these libraries installed. You can install them using the following:

pip install pandas numpy plotly

Here are a few additional instructions:

Ensure that you have a directory named 'dataset' in the same location as your script or notebook, and the dataset files are placed inside that directory.

The datasets being used are:

country_wise_latest.csv
day_wise.csv
worldometer_data.csv
full_grouped.csv
covid_19_clean_complete.csv

Check the file paths in the pd.read_csv statements to ensure they match the location of your dataset files.

Run the code block by block or all at once, depending on your preference.

Observe the output in the form of various visualizations generated by the plotly library.
